# 🦑🎮 Squid Game, Except It's Coding Interview Questions. 🎮🦑

This is a multi-player Leetcode-style project; where you're given a question and must solve that question with code, or **DIE!** (Not really... you just lose the game)

Demo: https://squidgame-eight.vercel.app/game/M5evDL5e7XkvMdtI1hc0

It's built using my go-to stack:

- Next JS 🖤
- Firebase 🔥
- Material UI 💅
- TypeScript 💁
- _Some code generated by GitHub Copilot_ 🤖

The code is not very "_cleaned-up_", and could use a lot of separation _(and testing)_, but I think it is a good demonstration of how you can use these tools to build out something really cool, and really quickly.

If you enjoy the code or the game, please consider starring the repo and checking out my socials!
